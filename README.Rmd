The `mpipe` package is designed to add to extra functionality to the "pipelining" of `tidyverse` style processes. When running a pipeline, it is common to break out of a pipeline to perform other actions, and then to commence a new pipeline. `mpipe` aims to permit a stronger use of pipelining, whilst reducing the need to break out. This piece of software is still under very active development and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mpipe` from [GitHub](https://github.com/MyKo101/mpipe) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("MyKo101/mpipe")
library(mpipe)
```

The `mpipe` package is not currently available on CRAN.

## fseq
A little used feature of the `magrittr` package's `%>%` pipe is that is can be used to create functions. By using a `.` as the initial argument, the output will be a function and can be applied to other pieces of data. These kinds of functions are called `fseq` functions (short for functional sequences).

```{r fseq_define_f}
f <- . %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarise_all(mean)
f
```

The `mpipe` package includes a couple of extra things that can be done to these packages, including composition of `fseq` by adding them together

```{r fseq_define_g}
g <- . %>%
  filter(Sepal.Length > 5.2) %>%
  select(Species,Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width)
g
```

```{r fseq_add}
g+f
```

```{r fseq_add_apply}
(g+f)(iris)
```

It also includes a `length()` method for `fseq` which returns the number of elements in the functional sequence, as well as a pair of functions to check whether something is an `fseq`: `is.fseq()` and `is_fseq()` (depending on your own preference)

## Side Effects

A large reason for breaking out of a pipeline is to do actions such as plotting or providing feedback to the user. the `mpipe` package provides two functions that are particularly useful for avoiding leaving a pipeline. The way this is done is that the functions side effects are activated, but the functions return an untouched version of the data it was originally provided. 

* `pipe_qplot()` - allows the user to create `ggplot2` style plots using `qplot()` syntax (akin to the base R `plot()` syntax)
* `pipe_cat()` - allows the user to output information to the console (or any other sink) in the much the same way that `cat()` does. Any calls/functions will be evaluated appropriately for this output.

```{r side_effects_example}
iris %>%
  tibble %>%
  select(Species,Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width) %>%
  pipe_qplot(Sepal.Length,Sepal.Width,col=Species) %>%
  pipe_cat("Total Average Sepal.Length: ",mean(Sepal.Length),"\n") %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  pipe_cat(as.character(Species)," Average Sepal.Length: ",mean(Sepal.Length),"\n") %>%
  summarise(Length_mean = mean(Sepal.Length),
            Width_mean = mean(Sepal.Width))

```


## Control Flow

One of the key aspects of programming is being able to manipulate which lines of code are ran and when. This manipulation is called "Control Flow" (i.e. you control the flow of the processes through your code). The two main methods of this are via branches and loops. Branches force our code to make a choice, where loops allow repetition of the same lines of code.

In traditional R (as in many other languages), Branching is performed using `if()` or `switch()` statements, and can also be vectorised with functions such as `if_else()` and `case_when()`. Loops are implemented using the `for()`, `while()` and `repeat()` statements and can essentially be vectorised using the `apply()` and `map()` families of functions. 

### Branches

The `if_branch()` and `switch_branch()` functions allow branching similar to `if()` and `switch()` statements. The `if_branch()` function chooses whether to proceed with the `fun` branch or the `elsefun` branch (if supplied) depending on how `predicate` is evaluated.

```{r if_example_def}
f <- . %>%
  multiply_by(2) %>%
  if_branch(. %>% equals(2),
            . %>%
              multiply_by(3) %>%
              add(2)) %>%
  multiply_by(2)
```

```
f(1):-
1 %>%
  multiply_by(2) %>% # => 1*2 = 2
  if_branch(. %>% equals(2), # TRUE
            . %>%
              multiply_by(3) %>% # => 2*3 = 6
              add(2)) %>% # => 6+2 = 8
  multiply_by(2) # => 8*2 = 16
```
```{r if_example1,echo=F}
f(1)
```

```
f(2):-
2 %>%
  multiply_by(2) %>% # => 2*2 = 4
  if_branch(. %>% equals(2), # FALSE
            . %>%
              multiply_by(3) %>% 
              add(2)) %>%
  multiply_by(2) # => 4*2 = 8
```
```{r if_example2,echo=F}
f(2)
```

Similarly, the `switch_branch()` function allows us to expand on this by following a different path depending on the evaluation of `case`

```{r switch_example_setup}
f <- . %>%
  sample_n(nrow(.)) %>%
  switch_branch(. %>% # What Species ends up at the top row?
                  slice(1) %>% #Choose a path, based on that
                  pull("Species") %>%
                  as.character,
                setosa = . %>%
                  pipe_cat("setosa was one top\n") %>%
                  filter(Species == "setosa"),
                versicolor = . %>%
                  pipe_cat("versicolor was on top\n") %>%
                  filter(Species == "versicolor"),
                virginica = . %>%
                  pipe_cat("virginica was on top\n") %>%
                  filter(Species == "virginica")) %>%
  slice(1)

```


```{r switch_example1}
## Force the "random" shuffle to put a "virginica" Species is at the top
set.seed(100)
f(iris)
```

```{r switch_example2}
## Force the "random" shuffle to put a "verisicolor" Species is at the top
set.seed(1000)
f(iris)
```

```{r switch_example3}
## Force the "random" shuffle to put a "setosa" Species is at the top
set.seed(10000)
f(iris)

```


### Loops

In terms of loops, we have the `while_pipe()` function which acts similar to a `while()` loop, but within a pipeline. It will repeatedly apply the `fun` argument to the `data` until `cond` is not `TRUE`. `cond` will be evaluated within the context of `data`. The `while_pipe()` function also provides a `.counter` pronoun to keep track of how many times the loop as been run (however any `cond` that evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE` similar to the `if_branch()` function will work).

```{r while_example}
tibble(x = runif(5)) %>%
  while_pipe(.counter <= 5,
             . %>%
               mutate(!!paste0("x_",.counter) := x - x[.counter]))
  

```
