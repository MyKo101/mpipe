The `mpipe` package provides added functionality to pipelines. With the "good grammar" associated with `tidyverse`  


## Installation

You can install the development version of `typos` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MyKo101/mpipe")
```
## Example: `if_pipe()`

Within programming, there exists two fundamental methods of code manipulation: branches and loops. Both of these are avaliable in `R` with functions such as `if()` and `else()` for branching and `for()` or `while()` for looping. Looping has been moved on to a more advanced state with the `apply()` family of functions and integrated into `tidyverse` within the `purrr` package. However, there is no "pipe-able" method to perform branching.

The `if_pipe()` function introduces a pipe-able branch for your code so you don't need to break out of your current pipeline.

```{r if-pipe-eg}

get_grouped <- T

10 %>%
  seq_len %>%
  tibble(id=.) %>%
  mutate(groups=sample(letters[1:3],n(),replace=T),
         x=runif(n()),
         y=runif(n())) %>%
  if_pipe(get_grouped,
          group_by(groups) %>%
            summarise(x.mean=mean(x),
                      x.sd = sd(x),
                      y.mean=mean(y),
                      y.sd = sd(y)) %>%
            expand(x=rnorm(10,x.mean,x.sd),
                   y=rnorm(10,y.mean,y.sd)) %>%
            ungroup,
          mutate(x = x^2,y=y^2))

```

Without `if_pipe()`, the above code would
