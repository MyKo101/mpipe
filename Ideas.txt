pipe_func:
performs piping as a function
pipe_func(lhs,rhs) == lhs %>% rhs


if_pipe:
Works like if_fun, except actually pipes rather than performs a function


pipe_pull:
pulls a variable out of a table, saves it as a variable in the parent environment and outputs the original table

pipe_cache:
Very complicated. Creates a new pipe function that caches outputs as it goes. Allowing the end of a pipe to be re-run quicker.
